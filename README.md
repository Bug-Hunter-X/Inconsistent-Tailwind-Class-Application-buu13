# Inconsistent Tailwind Class Application

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not consistently applied. Some classes work as expected, while others are ignored or applied incorrectly. The cause is likely related to configuration or conflicting styles.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Start the development server.
4. Observe that some Tailwind classes in `bug.js` do not render correctly, while others do.

## Solution

The solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`. It involves verifying the Tailwind CSS configuration, checking for CSS specificity conflicts, and ensuring that PurgeCSS (or similar) is configured correctly if used.
